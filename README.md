# setuptools-test

I wanted to learn more about setuptools and deploying packages to pypi.
Additionally, I wanted to learn more about entrypoints, which allow for 'true' cli - calling commands directly.

## Usage

Recommend setting up a virtual environment

`pip install tpackage` - pip detects setup.py in folder and installs module

Then you can call the function in command line with just `general`! 

Wonder how namespacing works... [https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3454](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3454)

Next steps - additional features, actually publishing to pypi, who knows!
